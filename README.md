## Project overview
Create a calculator app that can perform the four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

It will have a single input button, which will accept user input (any number) and a total starting with a zero.

Once a user types into the input field, they will then have to update the total by pressing any of the four math operation buttons:
    - addition 
    - subtraction 
    - multiplication 
    - division 

Here's a diagram of the completed calculator app:
